# The-Beat-Battle

The Beat Battle is a game built as the first project in the frames of the Ironhack Full Stack Web Development bootcamp

## The Game Rules

The game is played using the mouse. On the left side of the screen, the player has a pad that contains 4 rows of 6 different sounds. Rows represent time signatures ("bars"), and the player can switch the sounds on and off to play or mute them.
A battle takes place where, on each round, the player hears a beat and then needs to reproduce it in a limited time. 
Once the time has ellapsed or if the player did the right pattern, the game moves to the next round.

## Inspirations

My main inspirations for this project were Dev Ed's [Tap Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VJlzeEVL8A) and Wes Bos [Drum Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuN8qwZoego), as well as the tradition music hardware and software that allow to create instrument loops.

## Technology Used

The whole game is written in JavaScript ES6, HTML5 and CSS3, all interactions are achieved using DOM manipulations, and no extra libraries were used.

## Special Thanks

My special thanks go to the Ironhack teaching staff who helped us all along the project: Pierre, Montasar, Svenja, Bruno, and Min.
